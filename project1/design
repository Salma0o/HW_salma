1-strip the sentence
2-make are letter lower
3-count the appearance of each letter
4-create a function that will replace the letters according to ‘e’,’t’,’o’,’r’.back and forth


‘a’ = ‘e’, ‘e’=’a’, ’b’ =‘t’, ‘t’ = ‘b’.
So if the most common letters, for example, are ‘a’ , ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’ we will receive the following logic.:
In the first part we would like to run over the text string and save our described connection between the
letters into a dictionary. For the above example we will receive the following dictionary:
{'a': 'e', 'c': 'o', 'b': 't', 'e': 'a', 'd': 'r', 'o': 'c', 'r': 'd', 't': 'b'}
The function will return the dictionary with the logic.
Notes:
● The dictionary will include just our four most common letters and the letters that there are
connected to. For example, if ‘x’ is the fifth most common letter it will not appear in the
dictionary.
● Some characters are not alphabetical letters, like ‘>’ for example. Please specify your code to use
just alphabetical letters for dictionary creation.
● The code must be case insensitive but in the dictionary please present just the lower case of
each character.
Assumptions:
● There are at least four different letters in your text.
● For every popular letter, there is no letter that appears the same number of times.
● The most popular letters are different from ‘e’,’t’,’o’,’r’.
Check steps:
● In order to check that your results, are right you can print your dictionary that you created in the
function. Then you can count manually the four most common letters in the string and check if it
corresponds to your dictionary
